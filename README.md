## 🚀 **The Problem**

Traditional proxy tools like **Burp Suite** fail when dealing with:
- 📱 **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** applications
- 🔒 **Certificate pinning** implementations
- 🛡️ **Custom security protocols**
- 🔐 **TLS/SSL bypass restrictions**
- 🌐 **Devices using VPN connections**



**KnoxSpy** solves this by hooking directly into popular network libraries at **runtime**, even when the API traffic is routed through a VPN.

---

## 🎯 **Key Features**

### 🔥 **Advanced Interception**
- **Runtime Hooking**: Bypass certificate pinning and security restrictions
- **Multi-Platform**: Android (OkHttp3) and iOS (Alamofire/AFNetworking) support
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Live traffic capture and analysis

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Hook Generation (New!)**
Powered by the new **`apk-network-hook-generator`** skill, KnoxSpy now writes its own hooks:
- **Zero-Touch Decompilation**: Automatically reverse-engineers any arbitrary APK to expose its underlying architecture.
- **Smart Network Discovery**: Dynamically detects the app's framework (Native, Flutter, React Native) and pinpoints obfuscated HTTP libraries.
- **Instant Weaponization**: Generates ready-to-deploy, `frida-compile` compatible TypeScript agents that seamlessly bypass security protections and stream traffic directly into KnoxSpy.

### 🛠️ **Professional Toolkit**
- **Traffic Replay**: Replay captured requests for testing
- **Session Management**: Multiple concurrent testing sessions

### 🎨 **Modern Interface**
- **Vue.js Frontend**: Responsive, intuitive web interface
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates and communication

## ⚡ **Quick Start**

### 🔧 **Prerequisites**
- **Frida Server** 16.2.1 installed on target device
- **Node.js** 18+ for development
- **Android/iOS** device with USB debugging enabled

> **Note:** Android device has to be rooted

### 🚀 **Installation**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/appknox/knoxspy.git
cd knoxspy

# Install dependencies
cd app/gui && npm install
cd ../server && npm install
cd ../..

# Start the application
./knoxspy
```

### 🎯 **Usage**

1. **Connect Device**: Ensure Frida server is running on your target device
2. **Launch KnoxSpy**: Run `./knoxspy` to start both frontend and backend
3. **Access Interface**: Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
4. **Create Session**: Set up a new testing session
5. **Select App**: Choose the target application from the device
6. **Select Library**: Choose the library being used by the application
7. **Capture Traffic**: Switch to the Proxy tab and start intercepting

## 🔬 **Technical Deep Dive**

### 🏗️ **Architecture**
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 + TypeScript + PrimeVue
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + WebSocket
- **Database**: SQLite for session and library management
- **Instrumentation**: Frida + Custom JavaScript/TypeScript agents

### 🎭 **Supported Libraries**
| Platform | Library | Coverage |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Android | OkHttp3 | ✅ Full Support |
| iOS | Alamofire | ✅ Full Support |
| iOS | AFNetworking | ✅ Full Support |
| Custom | User Scripts | ✅ Extensible |

### 🔌 **Custom Agent Support**
Upload your own Frida agents as ZIP files:
- Must contain `package.json`
- TypeScript source automatically compiled
- Stored in `libraries/` directory
- Database tracking for metadata

> **Note on Frida 17+:** Due to changes in Frida 17, plain JavaScript hook scripts that rely on the `Java` global object no longer work. Custom agents must now be bundled using `frida-compile` and explicitly include `frida-java-bridge` to function correctly.

**Example: Writing and Compiling a Custom Hook**

1. Create your hook in a TypeScript file (`custom_hook.ts`):
```typescript
import Java from "frida-java-bridge";
(globalThis as any).Java = Java;

Java.perform(() => {
    console.log("Hooking into Java API...");
    // Your hook logic here
});
```

2. Compile it using `frida-compile`:
```bash
npx frida-compile custom_hook.ts -o custom_hook.js
```

3. Move `custom_hook.js` into the `libraries/` directory and update your configuration.
